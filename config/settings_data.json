Everything is available to <a href=\"https:\/\/nutritioncommunity.katefarms.com\/collections\">order<\/a> and ship right to your facility, download digitally, or both! <br><br>We recommend getting started by ordering a few cases of the formulas you will recommend most so that you always have a carton on hand to provide to a patient. Compliment that sample with a coupon from our recommendation tear pad so that you can provide your patients with a discount on their first katefarms.com order. Next, check out the patient literature available to order in print or download from our <a href=\"https:\/\/nutritioncommunity.katefarms.com\/pages\/patient-literature\">Patient Literature<\/a> section. All PDFs can be downloaded, printed, or emailed to your patient. Before logging out for the day, scan through our <a href=\"https:\/\/nutritioncommunity.katefarms.com\/pages\/medical-education\">Medical Education<\/a> offerings. New courses will be added regularly, and you can earn 1 CEU credit for every course completed. <br>\n<br>Have ideas for resources that would be helpful for your practice?

Everything is available to <a href=\"https:\/\/nutritioncommunity.katefarms.com\/collections\">order<\/a> and ship right to your facility, download digitally, or both! <br><br>We recommend getting started by ordering a few cases of the formulas you will recommend most so that you always have a carton on hand to provide to a patient. Compliment that sample with a coupon from our recommendation tear pad so that you can provide your patients with a discount on their first katefarms.com order. Next, check out the patient literature available to order in print or download from our <a href=\"https:\/\/nutritioncommunity.katefarms.com\/pages\/patient-literature\">Patient Literature<\/a> section. All PDFs can be downloaded, printed, or emailed to your patient. Before logging out for the day, scan through our <a href=\"https:\/\/nutritioncommunity.katefarms.com\/pages\/medical-education\">Medical Education<\/a> offerings. New courses will be added regularly, and you can earn 1 CEU credit for every course completed. <br>\n<br>Have ideas for resources that would be helpful for your practice?
